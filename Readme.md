# mSCOPE

mSCOPE is an integrated multi-layer model of vegetation reflectance, photosynthesis, fluorescence, temperature and energy balance.


## Brief introduction

This version of the mSCOPE model (mSCOPE_v1_beta) is based upon the SCOPE model (v1.61). It simulates the light interaction and energy balance of vertically heterogeneous canopies. 
mSCOPE keeps the same model structure and output of SCOPE, but uses a different solution for the radiative transfer of incident and emitted radiation in vegetation canopies.  
Questions related to mSCOPE, please contact p.yang@utwente.nl; or peiqiyangweb@gmail.com (Peiqi Yang). 

### Prerequisites

The model is written in Matlab codes. It was developed and tested using Matlab 2017. Using older versions may lead to some problems.
```
For example, the matrix multiplication used in RTMo_m.m and RTMf_m.m. 
To do the multiplication of two matrices with the dimension of 60x2162 (A) and 60x1 (B), in the older versions, one may need to use a loop 
for j=1:60
C(j,:) = A(j,:)*B(j)
end
While, in Matlab 2017 or later versions, it is simply computed as A*B;
```
The input data are structured in a excel spreadsheet. The users are expected to have the Microsoft installed. 
If there is not, please contact p.yang@utwente.nl. This issue can be easily fixed by giving alternative  inpute options.

##  Summary of the main changes in mSCOPE
a. input_mSCOPE.m 
It reads the vertical profiles of leaf optical properties (e.g. Cab, Cw) from input_data.xlsx in spratsheet 'mSCOPE'
The input_mSCOPE is called in the main function mSCOPE.m L61 before executing fluspect_mSCOPE and canopy RTMs. 

b. fluspect_mSCOPE.m 
It runs fluspect_b for different layers to obtain leaf reflectance, transmittance, Mb and Mf
fluspect_mSCOPE is called in the main function mSCOPE.m L249

c. RTMo_m.m 
It is a replacement of the RTMo.m in SCOPE. 
RTMo_m.m is called in the main function mSCOPE.m L279 
 Many changes have been made here
 
 convert scattering and extinction coefficients into thin layer reflectances and transmittances
 ``` 
tau_ss = repmat(1-k.*iLAI,nl,1);
tau_dd = 1-a.*iLAI;
tau_sd = sf.*iLAI;
rho_sd = sb.*iLAI;
rho_dd = sigb.*iLAI;  
```
calculation of effective transmittance and reflectance of a layer bounded beneath a surface
```
for j=60:-1:1 % from bottom to top. note 61 the background. 1 is the top of canopy.
Xss(j)      = tau_ss(j);
dnorm       = 1-rho_dd(j,:).*R_dd(j+1,:);
Xsd(j,:)    = (tau_sd(j,:)+tau_ss(j).*R_sd(j+1,:).*rho_dd(j,:))./dnorm;
Xdd(j,:)    = tau_dd(j,:)./dnorm;
R_sd(j,:)   = rho_sd(j,:)+tau_dd(j,:).*(R_sd(j+1,:).*Xss(j)+R_dd(j+1,:).*Xsd(j,:));
R_dd(j,:)   = rho_dd(j,:)+tau_dd(j,:).*R_dd(j+1,:).*Xdd(j,:);
end
``` 
fluxes  profiles 
``` 
% Eq. 19 in mSCOPE paper
Es_(1,:)       = Esun_;
Emin_(1,:)     = Esky_;
for j=1:60 % from top to bottom
Es_(j+1,:)    =   Xss(j).*Es_(j,:);
Emin_(j+1,:)  =   Xsd(j,:).*Es_(j,:)+Xdd(j,:).*Emin_(j,:);
Eplu_(j,:)    =   R_sd(j,:).*Es_(j,:)+R_dd(j,:).*Emin_(j,:);
end
``` 

d. RTMf_m.m
It is a replacement of the RTMf.m in SCOPE. Many changes have been made here.
